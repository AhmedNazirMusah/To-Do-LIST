## Getting Started

**clone this repo and go live with this TO-do list application.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty To Do List placeholder (<div> or <ul> element);
Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys:
description [string].
completed [bool].
index: [number].
Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
